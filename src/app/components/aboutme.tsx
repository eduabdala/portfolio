            Hi, I'm <strong>Eduardo S. Abdala</strong> — a Software Engineering
            student, developer, and technology enthusiast based in Porto Alegre,
            Brazil. I'm passionate about creating solutions that blend software
            with science, especially in the fields of electronics, bioinformatics,
            and environmental sustainability.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Currently, I work as a firmware development intern, where I explore
            embedded systems and low-level programming. I enjoy learning through
            hands-on projects — whether it's building a smart plant monitoring
            system, experimenting with microcontrollers, or designing tools for
            better human–tech interaction.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            I'm driven by curiosity and the desire to make a positive impact
            through technology. In the future, I aim to dive deeper into
            scientific research, especially in areas that connect computing,
            biology, and innovation. I'm also working toward becoming a skilled
            fullstack developer, capable of bringing ideas from concept to
            deployment.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Beyond tech, I find inspiration in music (I play the recorder),
            drawing, and exploring ideas through writing and personal blogs.
